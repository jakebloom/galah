                Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Jake, and Iâ€™m a former engineer at Facebook.
                <br /><br />
                I left a while back to start my own business, not realising just how hard it is to get your product in front of potential customers. 
                <br /><br />
                Marketing teams are being squeezed from all sides:
                <ul>
                    <li>You have to pay out the nose to produce high quality video content</li>
                    <li>You have to keep up with constant changes to Google and Facebookâ€™s targeting systems</li>
                    <li>You have to try understand why certain content didnâ€™t perform as you expected it to</li>
                </ul>
                And then you have to go ask your boss for more money to shoot another video while your ROAS is in the toilet!
                <br /><br />
                So I put together this guide to killer video ads, dissecting the top performing ads across Instagram Reels and TikTok.
                <br /><br />
                Video is the future of these platforms, the big companies know the tricks to huge CTRs and low CACs, and you need to know them too.
                <br /><br />
                So what are you waiting for? Download the free report and learn the secrets of video content that actually performs!
